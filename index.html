<b>Abstract:</b> <br>
This talk discusses Csound as a sound and music computing system at the centre of an
ecosystem of applications. For about fifteen years now, the software has developed a
formidable array of connections to other programs, at various levels of user interaction,
from high to low. Since its first release, Csound has provided an ideal studio platform for
research and production, providing means for extensions and connections to other
systems. In time, this ecosystem was widened as part of a calculated development
strategy that placed Csound at the centre of a variety of applications. In this talk, we
will explore the Csound ecosystem, with some illustrated examples. As part of this,
we will also evaluate critically these developments, proposing some thoughts for
the road ahead towards Csound 7.
